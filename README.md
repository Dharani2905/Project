Binary Classifcation: Diabetes Dataset

Using KNN techniques to predict whether a Pima Indian Woman has diabetes or not, based on
information about the patient such as blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), age, etc.

Introduction

Scientists carried out a study to investigate the signifcance of health-related predictors of
diabetes in Pima Indian Women. The study population was females (21 years and above) of
Pima Indian heritage.
The purpose of the study was to find out the factors that are associated with the presence of
diabetes in Pima Indians.
To find out the reason behind this, we have to first analyze the relationship between different
features, such as the number of times a woman was pregnant, their BMI, prevalence of diabetes,
etc.

Observations:

• From the correlation map you just obtained above, it seems that Insulin is highly correlated
with Glucose, BMI and Age. It means that as the values of glucose, BMI and Age increase,
the insulin is also increasing. It seems logical also that overweight and elderly people
might have a higher level of insulin in their bodies.


• In the same way SkinThickness is highly correlated with BMI.

A total of 768 women were registered in the database. 268 women had diabetes, while 500
women did not have diabetes.

It is surprising that the median BMI does not significanty change as the number of pregnancies
increases. Those who tested positive for diabetes had higher BMIs than those who did not.
However,there is not a very large difference between the medians.


BMI might be higher for women who have had more numbers of pregnancies as well as for those
who test positive for diabetes and that the relationship between the pedigree function and the
test results will show that those who had a higher pedigree function tested positive and those
